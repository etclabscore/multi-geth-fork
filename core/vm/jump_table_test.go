			Design Failure

			Aztlan decided to include EIP-2200 for SSTORE net gas metering.
			However, it did not thoroughly consider the facts that EIP-2200 is designed with the full context
			of Istanbul hard fork, whose pre-conditions that Aztlan does not fulfill.

			Net gas metering has a family of EIP specifications, including EIP-1283, EIP-1706 and EIP-2200.
			The specifications contain a parameter of "dirty gas", which is charged when a storage value has
			already been modified in the same transaction context. This value, as in the design intention,
			is expected to always equal to the value of SLOAD gas cost.
			In EIP-2200, this "dirty gas" is set to be 800, so as to accommodate EIP-1884â€™s gas cost change of SLOAD from 200 to 800.
			However, Aztlan does not include EIP-1884 but only applied EIP-2200,
			resulting in inconsistency in the EIP design intention, and may lead to unknown gas cost issues.

			This has also led to confusions in implementations. For example, a contributor previously merged an
			incorrect version of Aztlan hard fork into Parity Ethereum.
			This, if left unspotted, will lead to consensus split on the whole Ethereum Classic network.

			Recommendation: Remove EIP-2200 from the applied specification list, and add EIP-1283 with EIP-1706 instead.
